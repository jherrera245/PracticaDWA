        <p>
            You'll take my life, but I'll take yours too
            You'll fire your musket, but I'll run you through
            So when you're waiting for the next attack
            You'd better stand, there's no turning back
            The bugle sounds, the charge begins
            But on this battlefield, no one wins
            The smell of acrid smoke and horses' breath
            As I plunge on into certain death
            The horse, he sweats with fear, we break to run
            The mighty roar of the Russian guns
            And as we race towards the human wall
            The screams of pain as my comrades fall
            We hurdle bodies that lay on the ground
            And the Russians fire another round
            We get so near, yet so far away
            We won't live to fight another day
            We get so close, near enough to fight
            When a Russian gets me in his sights
            He pulls the trigger and I feel the blow
            A burst of rounds take my horse below
            And as I lay there gazing at the sky
            My body's numb and my throat is dry
            And as I lay forgotten and alone
            Without a tear, I draw my parting groan
